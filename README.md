## CRUD operations on Two Large Databases

Both the drug and the patient page allow signed-in doctors to see their drugs/patients and perform CRUD (create, retrieve, update, delete) operations.

I rebuilt fully functional REST API using Python and Flask (self-taught) for my backend.  

Psycopg2 adapter was used to connect Python to PostgreSQL database server.

## The Prescribe Page

The prescribe form is auto-complete which expedites the prescribing process.

Drop down menus appear when doctors type in just one letter in the form.

Prescribers can order medications for patients with the click of a button to avoid the hassle of handwritten scripts.

A success message is toasted when the prescription is sent to the pharmacy.
